# User Generator

-   Hello! This is a small project made using Vue 3, following [Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZXt1Aom3Cs) tutorial, but with some tweaks.

-   In my version, I also display the location (city and country) and the user's birthday.

-   This project features the [Random API](https://randomuser.me/), which was consumed using Fetch with Javascript.
